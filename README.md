# PDF Assistant

PDF Assistant is a project that uses Google's Generative AI and FAISS from LangChain Community to extract text from PDF documents, split the text into chunks, and generate embeddings for these chunks. It's a powerful tool for processing and understanding large volumes of text data in PDF format.
